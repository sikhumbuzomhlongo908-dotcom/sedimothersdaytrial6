Watching you be a mom is one of the most beautiful things ever. Like genuinely. You carry so much on your shoulders and somehow you still manage to love so deeply, care so much, and still be there. I know there are days where ukhathele, overwhelmed, stressed, emotionally drained, and probably questioning if you're doing enough… but you are doing more than enough actually.

Omphi is growing up with someone loving, strong, funny, caring and soft-hearted — ngithembe lokho kubaluleke kakhulu.

And can we talk about how you somehow manage to be a whole mom and still be cute 😭 like excuse me? One minute you're handling serious mom responsibilities, one minute you're being adorable and a cool mom, and the next minute ugaya umuthi wokuthi ngiku khumbule 😑

But jokes aside, I really admire you. Not just because you're a mother, but because of the type of mother you are. The way you love, the way you try, the way you keep going even when kunzima — it says so much about your heart.

I hope today reminds you that you deserve appreciation too. You deserve softness, reassurance, rest, love, comfort, and someone reminding you that you're doing an amazing job. And even though I may joke around a lot, I really do mean it when I say I'm proud of you.

Happy Mother's Day, Miss Wife ❤️

Keep being the beautiful person and amazing mom you are. And please remember to save some love for yourself too — and not just everyone else.`}</p>
